# JETPACK COMPOSE - Creating a TASK LIST App with Priority Levels

## Introduction

This project aims to create an Android application for task management, using the Jetpack Compose library. The application will allow users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks, as well as define priority levels for each of them.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Kotlin
- Development Framework: Jetpack Compose
- Tools: Android Studio, Git

## What Was Learned

Throughout the development of this project, knowledge was deepened in various areas:

- **Jetpack Compose:** Mastery of declarative and functional syntax for building modern and performant Android interfaces.
- **MVVM Architecture:** Implementation of a robust and organized architecture for managing data and application state.
- **Data Binding:** Efficient use of Data Binding to connect the user interface to application data.
- **Database Management:** Storage and retrieval of data persistently using Room.
- **Unit Testing:** Creation of unit tests to ensure code reliability.
- **Code Versioning:** Use of Git for version control and teamwork.

## App Features

- Task creation with title, description, and priority level (high, medium, low).
- Viewing a list of tasks ordered by priority and creation date.
- Editing tasks, including title, description, and priority level.
- Task deletion.
- Marking tasks as completed.
- Task filtering by priority and status (completed/pending).

## App Benefits

- **Organization and Productivity:** The application helps in organizing daily, weekly, and monthly tasks, increasing user productivity.
- **Time Management:** Setting priority levels allows users to focus on the most important tasks, optimizing available time.
- **Clear Visualization:** The application interface is intuitive and facilitates quick visualization of pending tasks.

## Conclusion

This project was a valuable opportunity to enhance knowledge in Android development with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. Through the creation of a functional and useful application, it was possible to consolidate skills in various essential areas for building modern and high-quality Android applications.

## Practical Application

This project demonstrates the ability to develop complete and usable Android applications using the latest technologies recommended by Google. The acquired skills can be applied in various professional contexts, such as:

- Mobile application development for companies and startups;
- Creation of personal apps for personal use or commercialization;
- Contribution to open-source projects in the Android community.

## Final Thoughts

Continuous learning is essential for success in the software development field. This project represents an important step in the learning journey, and the acquired skills will serve as a foundation for developing even more complex and innovative Android applications in the future.
